    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this exercise you will construct a metal complex and compute the splitting of the d-orbitals in the electrostatic field of ligands.

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ligand field theory is usually conceptualized as in the figure bellow. If a metal ion is put into a potential field of charged ligands the d-orbitals will first go higher in energy. Subsequently, the d-orbitals are split into two to five energy levels depending on the symmetry of the ligand field. In a case of octahedral ligand field, we obtain two new energy levels, the doubly degenerate e$_\\mathrm{g}$ level and triply degenerate t$_\\mathrm{2g}$ level. In the next section we will take a closer look to the origins of the splitting in the ligand field. As a result, a reader will be able to determine qualitatively the new energy levels of the d-orbitals only by specifying the ligand positions.\n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let us begin with the necessary theory needed to understand the idea of the ligand field theory. We start with a metal ion in vacuum, we restrict ourselves only to the d-orbitals and ignore all other shells. The d-orbitals are the solution of the Schrödinger equation of the metal ion in vacuum. In spherical coordinates we can write the d-orbital with a magnetic quantum number $m$ as:  \n",
    "<br><center>\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    d_{m}(r,\\theta,\\phi) = R(r) \\cdot Y^{m}_{l=2}(\\theta,\\phi)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "</center><br>\n",
    "where $R(r)$ is the radial part and $Y^{m}_{l=2}(\\theta,\\phi)$ is the angular part in a form of a spherical harmonic. Now, lets add ligands around the metal ion. Ligands will be represented by point charges. The potential of the ligand field with $N_L$ ligands positioned at $\\mathbf{R}_i$ with charge $q_i$ at a point $\\mathbf{r}$ is:\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the action of the ligand field, the d-orbitals (defined in Eq. 1) are no longer a solution of the Schrödinger equation. The solution can be, however, obtained as a linear combination of the d-orbitals that has the lowest energy. The fact that the best wavefunction will have the lowest energy is called the $\\textit{variational principle}$.\n",
    "To find the best wavefunction with the lowest energy we have to solve the so-called secular equations. That is a set of $N$ coupled equations where $N$ is the number of basis functions. In our case $N$ is equal to 5, the basis functions are the d-orbitals with different magnetic quantum number $m_l = -l,\\dots,l$ ($l=2$ for d-orbitals). The secular equation for a magnetic quantum number $m$ would have a form:\n",

These integrals are called the $\\textit{resonance integrals}$. In Eq. 4 we substituted the resonance integral by term the $V_{m',m}$ to simplify the whole expression. Secular equations are a system of coupled equations due to the presence of the sum over $m'$, which means that they cannot be solved individually.\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a first glance this seems to be a quite complicated expression, but there is nothing to be afraid of. Lets break down the integral in Eq. 9 into the individual terms. \n",
    "We notice that each ligand contributes to the integral with three terms (content of the braket), each of these terms consists of a tabulated constant ($A_{m',m}$, $B_{m',m}$ and $C_{m',m}$), Slater$-$Condon parameter (F$_4$, F$_2$ and F$_0$) and the so-called structure parameter which has a form a spherical harmonic.\n",

    "\n",

    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tabulated constants $A_{m',m}$, $B_{m',m}$ and $C_{m',m}$ arise from the angular part of the integral defined in Eq. 8, they were evaluated once for all and can be found in the literature.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Slater$-$Condon parameters F$_4$, F$_2$ and F$_0$ comes from the radial part of the integral in Eq. 8. They depend on a distance of the ligand from the metal ion. They can be in principle evaluated to get the new energies of the d-orbitals, this would, however, lead to ultimately absurd numbers! The Slater$-$Condon parameters are not evaluted, the new energies of the d-orbitals are obtained as a function of these parameters and their values are then determined by comparison with an experiment of with an $\\textit{ab initio}$ calculation.\n",

    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angular positions of the ligands ($\\theta_i$ and $\\phi_i$) are inserted via the structure parameters which have a form the spherical hamonics with angular quantum number equal to the index of the Slater$-$Condon parameter. That is $Y_l(\\theta_i,\\phi_i)$ where $l=0,2,4$. Lets take a closer look on the very last term in Eq. 9, the positions of the ligands enter here through $Y_0(\\theta_i,\\phi_i)$. An attentive reader might notice that $Y_0$ is actually the angular part of a s-orbital, which has a spherical symmetry. This means that regardless of the ligand position, the $Y_0(\\theta_i,\\phi_i)$ will always have the same value! This last term is then the spherical potential of the ligands which only lifts up the energy of the d-orbitals but does not cause any splitting. Terms responsible for the splitting are the first two in Eq. 9.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is the take-away message for the reader? Lets recap the above part without any math. We started with a metal ion in vacuum, the solution of the Schrödinger equation was represented by 5 d-orbitals. Then, we added ligands around the metal ion as point charges. \n",
    "We tried to find a new solution of the Schrödinger equation with the potential of the ligands accounted in the Hamiltonian. To do that, we employed the variational principle (i.e. the best wavefunction has the lowest energy) which led to a system of secular equations. By solving these equations we obtained the new energy levels of the d-orbitals in the ligand field. \n",
    "In the secular equations we had to evaluate the resonance integrals, here we made a use of a prior work of chemists and physicists who already found the analytical expressions for these integrals. We have evaluated these integrals except for their radial part, which we treated as a parameter. These parameters can be later obtained from spectroscopic measurements or from $\\textit{ab initio}$ calculations.     \n",

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we construct a molecular orbital diagram, we subsequently fill it with electrons, configuration with the lowest energy has to satisfy the Pauli principle and the Hund rules. It may, however, also happen that two or more of these configurations will have a similar (or even the same) energy, in this case the system will be in a superposition of these configurations. This is the so-called $\\textit{multi-reference}$ state, such states occur often in transition metal complexes. The usual way how to deal with multi-reference cases in quantum chemistry is the Complete Active Space (CAS) calculation. In this method instead of exploring all possible configurations of all electron in all orbitals, we rather choose much smaller (but chemically important) space and explore all possible configurations within this space (the so-called active space). \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lets demonstrate the situation on the Cr$^{3+}$ ion. The configuration of this ion in vacuum is d$^3$ (3 electrons in the d-orbitals). Once we put this ion in the octahedral field the d-orbitals will split into two energy levels (t$_\\mathrm{2g}$ and e$_\\mathrm{g}$), the configuration with the lowest energy will be t$_\\mathrm{2g}^3$e$_\\mathrm{g}^0$ (3 electrons in t$_\\mathrm{2g}$ and zero electrons in e$_\\mathrm{g}$ level). But how the situation will look like if we perturb the octahedral geometry or if we are interested in the excited state? To answer question like these we can make use of the quantum chemical calculation.\n",
