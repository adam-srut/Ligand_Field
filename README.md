# Ligand Field Theory
Exercise for the Physical Chemistry internship at TU Darmstadt

The exercise sheet you are going to work with is the Jupyter notebook `Ligand_field_theory.ipynb`. Everything including running the *ab initio* calculations can be done in there.
Directories `Cr_*` contain input files for the *ab initio* calculations which are also intendet to be run in these directories.
Source code of the exercise can be found in the `LF_functions.jl` file.

  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Julia language with packages:
    - Luxor, Plots
    - DataFrames
    - LaTeXStrings
